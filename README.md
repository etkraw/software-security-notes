# software-security-notes
## notes from a software security engineering course

# objectives

This course took a very offensive approach to teaching software security. In 
an offensive scenario, your goal as an attacker ('hacker', if you will) is to 
be able to arbitrarially execute code on a victim's machine. Usually, this 
means popping a shell with root priveledges. Sometimes you can't do this, so 
just altering program flow to do your bidding works, too. In any case, the victim 
program or machine must have a bug, and you must have a way to exploit it.

# file organization

The directories are layed out as follows:

- **notes** contains lecture notes, with titles numerically prefixed to 
  show the order topics were covered in.

- **hints** contains hints and tips for working with tools, common problems, 
  etc.

- **scripts** contains useful scripts for solving challenges, and are well 
  commented.

- **writeups** contains challenge writeups, *or* maybe just hints and a 
  short explaination of how they were solved. Titles of challenges are 
  ommited, both for academic honesty reasons and to stop any free loading 
  kiddos!
